        <p>Hrithik Roshan was recently seen in a rugged avatar for the commercial of his lifestyle apparel and casual wear brand HRX. The actor is in collaboration with an online portal which will be retailing the brand. The commercial repeatedly reinforces the fact that one shouldn’t give up, should keep going and giving it their all.

Giving up isn’t in his dictionary

The actor truly believes in this saying and follows it whole-heartedly as well. His hard work for the ad campaign is a clear example, where he supposedly shot for the same at a 21 hour stretch. Not only this, Hrithik is known to be a man who slogs to get it right. Be it his dedication towards his films, roles or work in general, the Bang Bang actor has always been ahead in the game.</p>
